Questions :

- Why should we run the container with a flag -e to give the environment variables?

Environnements variables often contains critical informations that are not meant to be written in readable files.
For our example, if I published my code on github, my database credentials would be easily readable and malicious
people could connect to it and use my data for unauthorized purposes.
The -e command is a way to give db's credentials outside the Dockerfile.

- Why do we need a volume to be attached to our postgres container?

Docker containers are meant to be expandable. If we had to save data before killing our containers each time we update
it, we would all go insane. The use of volumes helps us making this process automatic !

1-1 Document your database container essentials: commands and Dockerfile.

Our app is currently composed of two containers instanciated by two images each created with a Dockerfile.
The database Dockerfile is located on "db" folder and the Adminer in "adminer" one. These two containers are
connected by the network "tp-app-network".

First of all create the network :

$ docker network create tp-app-network

To run the db, please use these command lines :

$ docker build -t tp-db db/.  #build the image "tp-db" using the Dockerfile located in db/.
$ docker run -d -p 55432:5432 -v /sql:/var/lib/postgresql/data --net=tp-app-network --name=tp-db tp-db 

This last line run in detached mode (-d) the container tp-db (--name) on the port 5432 mapped on the 55432 of your machine
(you can change 55432 for another port if it's already used). It copies the local files "db/sql/." inside the container's
filesystem. It protects data from being wiped out during container rebuilding. It connects the container to the 
"tp-app-network" network.

To run adminer it's nearly the same commands :

$ docker build -t tp-adminer adminer/.
$ docker run -d -p 88080:8080 --net=tp-app-network --name=tp-adminer tp-adminer

You can now connect to your app on ip : http://localhost:88080
Login with your credentials.
